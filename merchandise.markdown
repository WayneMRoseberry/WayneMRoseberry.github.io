      <b><i>Writing Test Plans Made Easy</i></b><br><br>
      Many of the testers working for me had trouble writing test plans. Most of them were either suffering from writers
block, or were struggling with how to represent their testing ideas. I found a simple, fast, outline based
format helped my testers get ideas on paper quickly that were easy to understand and review. I share that approach in this book.<br><br>

      <b><i>Be reasonable. Don't give the monkey the gun.</i></b><br><br>
        There is a simple solution to AI run amok. Don't give it control over anything dangerous. We would
        apply the same rule to monkeys and guns. It seems appropriate to use a similar approach with
        AI. Doesn't it?<br><br>

    Whistler's Mother Dragon t-shirt.<br>
    The real name of the original is "Arrangement in Grey and Black no. 1", but it's more fun to call it Whistler's Mother. It's even more fun when she is a dragon.<br><br>
