title: '"I am so done" with the "tester mindset".'
---

When I get close to finishing something I start to slide
into a "I am so done" mood that makes it difficult to
work on remaining work. This includes adopting a tester
mindset.

Here are some ways to help:
- Grit your teeth and go forward... there is something to being an adult and being a professional in this problem
- Do some test planning up front
- Use exploratory test activity on easy themes to force experience and reaction
- Give yourself a little bit of time
- Find a break before you are done with the coding task and do some testing then
- Put delivery of a testing report on your list of tasks
- Riff off your existing automation, "How can I make this do more?"
- Use lists of test ideas and categories
- Ask someone... or something... for ideas to test your work
- Swap testing with a colleague
- Pair testing
