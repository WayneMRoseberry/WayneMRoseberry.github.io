I recently wrote an article about creating a 
<a href="https://waynemroseberry.github.io/assets/DoesQA_selectorcomparison_elementaction_testspec.pdf">testing specification</a?
for covering some not-happy path cases for <a href="https://doesqa.qa">DoesQA</a>, a no-code
test automation service.

Today I executed the testing described in that specification. I sent
a report of my findings to Sam Smith, a founder at DoesQA. In this article, I describe that testing.

The test <a href="https://waynemroseberry.github.io/assets/DoesQA%20Actions%20and%20Selector%20Types%20Testing%20Report.pdf">report is located here</a>.
The raw testing <a href="https://waynemroseberry.github.io/assets/DoesQA%20selector%20testing%20notes%20january%2015%202024.pdf">notes are located here</a>.
