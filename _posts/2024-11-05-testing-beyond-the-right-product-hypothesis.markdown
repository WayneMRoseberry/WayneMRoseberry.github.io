Let's think about testing beyond the "Is this the right product?" hypotheses.
=========================
Recently, Alan Page wrote a <a href="https://angryweasel.substack.com/p/the-other-side-of-the-door?r=ngs26&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web">useful and well put article</a>
about testing product value via hypotheses. It is a straightforward, easy to imagine and understand
how-to method. Good stuff. I recommend giving it a read.

I want to follow it up with considering testing the example offered in the article
in ways that go beyond determining the product value. I want to talk about
the what a person testing the product, be that a developer or a tester
or any other member of the team, does in a way that complements
and assists the goal.

The Banner Example
=========================
In Alan's article, we are presented with a proposed addition of a banner
to a website. The purpose of the banner is to drive up user email
list sign-ups. The article then describes a hypothesis (and experiment)
driven approach to determine whether or not the change produces the
desired value, in this case driving up email-list sign-ups.

Let's frame that as a set of goals, both explicit and implicit:
- an effective experiment which can give us data we can use to test the hypothesis
- ultimately an increase in email-list sign-ups, with the experiment providing us the data to see if that relates to the banner change
- no negative value impact of the change or experiment on the rest of the site

To our business, these goals express a value of this experiment, this change, to
the business and to the customer. When we test, we are looking for something that
might threaten that value, might keep us from meeting those goals.

What Do We Test?
