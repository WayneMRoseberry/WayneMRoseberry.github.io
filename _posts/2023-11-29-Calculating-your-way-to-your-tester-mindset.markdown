Getting all mathy to think like a tester
========================================
This is article is part of a series where I describe
about interview questions I used to use to
check a testing candidate for strong testing
behaviors.

This question tends to do well at prompting candidates
to demonstrate either knowledge of, or intuition
for, formal testing construct with data
and processing of information. It requires some
degree of basic mathematical aptitude, probably
middle school level, but also some sense of where
realistic physical limits of computers and
problem solving have to introduce difficulty,
complexity, and most probably bugs.

We imagine a calculator...
========================================
I don't have a working code example for this
problem, because I exploit the free form
nature of role play to introduce conditions
that the candidate brings up. I modify parameters,
make up pretend behaviors so I can observe
their responses. If I had a real application, I
wouldn't have that freedom to explore their
behaviors.

The script goes like this:

> "Imagine you are testing a command line
> calculator application. Whatever you
> type it treats as a mathematical formula
> and dislays the result of the calculation
> on the next line after you hit the RETURN key.
>
> For simplicity sake, assume the calculator
> only supports the following operations:
> addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
>
> How would you go about testing this application?
