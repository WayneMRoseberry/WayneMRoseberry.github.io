A list I got from a tester friend of mine
> 1. Array lengths - shortest, very long, empty
> 2. Other properties in schema being short/long/empty/null should not affect it (or should?)
> 3. Security requirements (not a security expert) - does it protect against injection
> 4. Checking the implementation of "random" by running it repeatedly and making sure it returns different results
> 5. Checking that the randomness will not consistently skip certain locations within the array
> 6. Checking different formats of elements in the array, they could be strings, arrays, lists, ints, custom objects
> 7. How do you convert from the objects in the array to string format - tests around those
> 8. The arrays are in a list - use different list lengths, 0, 1, many
> 9. Arrays of different object types within the same list
> 10. How does it combine the end value when there are multiple elements in the list
> 11. Is the randomness consistent across multiple elements in the list
