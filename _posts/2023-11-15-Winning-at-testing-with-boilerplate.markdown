Dear _[[ INSERT TESTER NAME HERE ]]_, you have been selected to win _[[ INSERT PRIZE NAME HERE ]]_!
=====================================
I have a testing technique that reminds me of form letters, like those mass
mailings for sweepstakes promotions or credit card sales.

I stumbled across this technique a day or so ago  in a LinkedIn post when summarizingsome test preparation.
The actual preparation was a page or two of tables that I combined together to come up with test
cases for a new feature I was preparing to add. LinkedIn posts don't allow pages of
material, and I didn't have the time to write a longer article, so I was forced into coming up with
a short format to express the test ideas. Here is the post:

>Sometimes testing design is tedious and straightforward, but like a lot of work, still needs to happen.
>
>I am sometimes surprised in the mundane. There are interesting considerations, things easy to forget. 
>Today I was contemplating the tests needed in response to adding authentication and authorization 
>with a project of mine, and most of it really is _"try << action >> as << role >> when << authorized | unauthorized >>"_, 
>but even that had some optimizations and cases that I felt much better after writing down. 
>The test design also reminded me of some use cases I need to take into account on the feature.

The phrase _"try < action > as < role > when < authorized | unauthorized >"_ summarizes the page
and a half of my tables and matrices in one short statement. I realized everything I was doing
could be crystalized and understood by the readers without having to express any of the details.

The infinite and manageable power of boilerplate
=====================================
I sometimes think of logic or language or ideas as a form of algebra. As much as "mX + b" can describe the slope of an
infinite number of lines with an infinite number of slopes, so too can a statement describe an infinite
number of similiar situations. Consider this statement:

_Take the << animal >> to the << location >>._

 Any version of that statement is about taking some animal to some place, but there are also
 an infinite number of forms that statement could take:

* _Take the dog to the vet._
* _Take the monkey to the zoo._
* _Take the parakeet to 120 degrees north and 45 degrees west._

On first blush, one might have thought we were bound by a finite number of animals and
a finite number of locations, but if you notice on my parakeet example, we
open up the possibility of infinite statements by finer and finer precision on
what we mean by location. If we allow ourselves imaginary animals, or imaginary
specific animals ("Freddy the dog", "Freddy the Third, the dog", "Josephine the three finned wallobat")
we wind up with the same possibility there.

Despite contemplating infinity, we can still wrap our heads around the basic
idea of taking some animal to some place. The structure and content of the boilerplate
makes it easier to imagine. There are implied meanings that come with the boilerplate
that helps us understand the possibilities of outcomes, situations, conditions, and problems.
