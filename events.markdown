On November 8th, 2023 at 6:00 PM Pacific Time, I spoke about signals based testing
at the Quardev Quality Assurance Special Interest Group meeting. Thank you very much
to the team there, especially Jon Bach for moderating and tossing me
questions. The recording is <a href="https://qasig.org/2023/11/09/november-2023-qasig-signals-based-testing/">available here.</a>
