Many of the testers working for me had trouble writing test plans. Most of them were either suffering from writers
block, or were struggling with how to represent their testing ideas. I found a simple, fast, outline based
format helped my testers get ideas on paper quickly that were easy to understand and review. I share that approach in this book.

Conferences and Presentations
==========

Flaky Test Automation
---------------------
This is a presentation I gave describing how the Office team at Microsoft not just manages, but
utilizes flaky test results to their advantage. I describe the important difference between using
automation to gate code submissions versus using automation to find bugs, and how flaky test
automation is an important signal in both those activities.

Using Product Signal Information In Testing
---------------------
This is a presentation where I describe how we integrated product telemetry signals
with the automation systems in Office, and different ways of using that information to
infer information about product quality as well as assess the performance and quality
of your automation suite. This talk represents a key cornerstone priniple I used for
later research applying AI to product testing practices.
