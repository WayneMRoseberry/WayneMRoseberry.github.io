I have a broad range of experience, skills, and interests that may be useful for whatever project you have in mind.

Testing Expertise
=================
I have nearly three decades of experience testing computer software projects. I have worked on large scale online cloud
services, enterprise scale on-premise server products, client-server software, web sites, proprietary online services
and consumer products.

Leadership
=================
I am comfortable working with teams of people large and small. I know how to manage people directly, guiding them as
they grow their skills and build their careers. I know how to lead from the side, building processes, tools, systems, methods,
systems, and channels of information that help people follow a course, or set their own. I believe creating
software is a social, collaborative, creative process where people work best when they work together while
still having the power to make their own choices. I believe in creating an environment where taking risks
and learning is safe and supported.

Innovation
=================
I enjoy problems that haven't been solved yet. I enjoy inventing solutions to problems, and helping
other people build their own solutions. I am fascinated with the way new technologies like large scale
data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence provide a platform on which we can
constantly improve and achieve new things.
